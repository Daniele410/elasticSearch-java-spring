# Elasticsearch Spring Boot Application

## Overview
This application demonstrates how to integrate **Spring Boot** with **Elasticsearch**. It provides a REST API for managing products, including creating, reading, uploading via XML, and deleting records.

Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine that allows for storing, searching, and analyzing large volumes of data in near real-time.

## How to Run the Application Locally

### Prerequisites
1. Install [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html).
2. Install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
3. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
2. Start Elasticsearch using Docker:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name elastic-test -p 9200:9200 -e "discovery.type=single-node" -e "xpack.security.enabled=false" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.8.2
   ```
3. Build and run the Spring Boot application:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
4. Access the application at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Running the Application with Docker Compose

1. Build the application and create a Docker image:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install -DskipTests
   ```

2. Start the application using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:8080`, and Elasticsearch at `http://localhost:9200`.


4. For stop the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

**Note:** Ensure the `docker-compose.yml` file is present in the project root.
